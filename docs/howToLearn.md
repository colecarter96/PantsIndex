# How to Learn Something New

## Step 1:

Indentify what it is that you want to learn:

1. Identify what you want to know
2. Identify what it is that you don't know
3. Make a list of things to decide if you know it or not at the end

## Step 2:
 
 Create a list of the resources that you can use to learn and research the topic.

## Step 3:

Resarch using the resources while taking detailed notes somewhere like Notion.

## Step 4: 
 
Begin to try to implement what you've learned referencing the notes.

## Step 5:

If you run into gaps in your learning or you indentify a new concept that you didn't account for, go back to step 1 with these new topics.

## Step 6:

Continue broadening your use cases and continue to think critically using the new information gained!
