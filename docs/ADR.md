# ADR for Pants Index

## Decision: Front End

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

This will allow me to use the bare bones vanilla stuff as in sprint 1 I will only be doing sorting of the jeans

***Accepted***


## Decision: Back End

1. Serverless
2. JSON
3. JavaScript data maniputlation

This allows for deployment to be easier, trying to make it simple with least overhead

***Accepted***


## Decision: Deployment

Github Pages

This allows for free deployment directly from the repo. Can look into serverless deployment like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud and others

***Under Review***
