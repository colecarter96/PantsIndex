# Calling All Pants Enjoyers


This is my first post on this sub, but as a pod listener and someone who cares how I look, I often end up reading this sub. Now what I have learned is that people love pants, and they don't know where to find good pants. The best recs we get are Our Legacy Third Cut, STF 501s, Gap 90s loose jeans, and the craziest rec of all, vintage 550s with the hem too long so you can hem it and hopefully it won't taper too much.

Now I don't think these are bad recs, but for the broke boys like myself, the Third Cut collectors, and everyone in between I thought it would be nice if there was a tool that made it so we could all discover top-tier pants that fit us!

The idea is that if we all submit our favorite pants measurements then we will have a large Pokedex of Pants that we can sort by our specific measurements. The Pants Index.

I am not a web developer by any means, in fact, I kinda suck, however, my love for pants has inspired me. Now all it takes is if everyone could measure their favorite pairs of pants, and submit 
them to this google form:

I shall try to make you all happy in our pants journeys. For thy legs and fit pics. 

I made a mockup of the site to have something to show you to maybe inspire or entice you to measure your pants. I have linked that below.
