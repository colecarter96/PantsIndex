# Pants Index Philosphy

## For the `Homies`

With everything that is done in Pants Index it is always for the user of the site. My goal is to create the best tool for finding new garments that are worth the time! Never for me, only for me if I'm considered to be one of the users can it be for my benefit.

## *Simplicity*

I want the site to be very simple and easy to understand and use. It doesn't have to have a bunch of features, starting with one feature at a time and trying to nail it.

Trying to make it do what I want with the least amount of stuff. Trim away as much as possible without losing functionality.

## Learning

Always listening to the user and considering their ideas to make it the cleanest experience possible. 

## Adapting

Things have to adapt in order to grow. Always being willing to adapt as long as it stays consistent with the philosophy.
